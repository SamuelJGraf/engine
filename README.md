 # SecureCodeBox Engine â€“ the Core
 
This is the main component of the _secureCodeBox_ it's a [Camunda][camunda] [BPMN][bpmn] engine, which allows the engineer to build the whole scan process as a [BPMN][bpmn] model. This component also provides the main web UI: The _secureCodeBox_ control center. In this UI you can see the available scan process definitions as [BPMN][bpmn] diagrams, start them (Tasklist), and manually review the results. Furthermore, the core provides a possibility to listen on webhooks and integrate the exposed process API, allowing us to trigger the scan processes by a continuous integration component, such as [Jenkins][jenkins], in our example, or any other which can deal with webhooks.
 
 **Important note**: The _secureCodeBox_ is no simple one-button-click-solution! You must have a deep understanding of security and how to configure the scanners. Furthermore, an understanding ot the scan results and how to interpret them is also necessary.
